Enough theory. Let's build something real.

In the next 3 hours (of which you'll work for about 25 minutes), Ralph will build a complete BuzzFeed-style personality quiz—the kind that captures leads, goes viral, and actually makes money. Not a toy example. A production feature for a real pet sitting platform.

You'll see every step: the requirements conversation, the generated plan, the autonomous build, and—critically—how Ralph handles the inevitable snags that come up along the way.

{/* IMAGE: Terminal showing Ralph's progress bar with "8 tasks completed" and a clean git log */}

**What Ralph will build for you:**

- Interactive quiz: "What Type of Pet Sitter Are You?"
- 6 questions with weighted scoring and beautiful UI
- 5 personality types with full content and shareable results
- Lead capture with email collection (skip option included)
- Social sharing via Web Share API with clipboard fallback
- Convex backend for storing leads

**Time breakdown:** ~25 minutes of your attention + ~3 hours of autonomous Ralph time = a complete marketing feature.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed [Part 1](/blog/ralph-wiggum-part-1-introduction) and [Part 2](/blog/ralph-wiggum-part-2-methodology)
- Optional: [Part 3](/blog/ralph-wiggum-part-3-ralph-tui-monitoring) for monitoring setup
- Claude Pro or Max subscription
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Familiarity with Next.js and React

## Why a BuzzFeed Quiz?

Before we dive in, let's talk about why this is a perfect Ralph project.

BuzzFeed-style quizzes are proven lead generation machines. They're engaging, shareable, and provide genuine value to users. For a pet sitting platform, a "What Type of Pet Sitter Are You?" quiz:

1. **Qualifies leads** — People who complete the quiz are genuinely interested in pet sitting
2. **Provides value** — Users learn about their personality type and get actionable tips
3. **Encourages sharing** — "I got Animal Whisperer! 🐾" is naturally shareable
4. **Captures emails** — Users want their results, creating a natural exchange

This is also a great Ralph project because it has clear completion criteria, well-defined components, and testable outcomes—exactly what Ralph excels at.

## Project Context

We're adding this quiz to an existing Next.js project (a pet sitting platform) that uses:
- **Next.js 16** with App Router
- **Convex** for the backend
- **Clerk** for authentication
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui components

If you're following along with a fresh project, the patterns still apply—just adapt the tech stack.

## Project Setup

Create a new branch for this feature:

```bash
cd ~/Sites/petsitters  # or your project directory
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/buzzfeed-quiz
```

Install Ralph plugin if you haven't:

```bash
/plugin install ralph-loop@claude-plugins-official
```

## Phase 1: Requirements Definition (25 minutes)

This is the conversational phase where we work with Claude to define exactly what needs to be built. According to [The Ralph Playbook](https://claytonfarr.github.io/ralph-playbook/), you should spend 30+ minutes in this phase.

### The Conversation

**You:**
> "I want to build a BuzzFeed-style personality quiz called 'What Type of Pet Sitter Are You?' for lead generation. Let's define the requirements together."

**Claude:**
> "Great idea! BuzzFeed quizzes are excellent for engagement and lead capture. Let's break this down:
>
> 1. How many questions should the quiz have?
> 2. How many result types?
> 3. Do we need email capture? Before or after showing results?
> 4. Should results be shareable?"

**You:**
> "Let's do 6 questions with 4 options each. 5 personality types for results. Yes to email capture—show it after the last question but before results, with a 'skip' option. Results should be shareable on social media."

**Claude:**
> "Perfect. For the personality types, what archetypes make sense for pet sitters?"

**You:**
> "Something like: Adventure Seeker (loves travel), Home Guardian (reliable local), Professional Carer (career-focused), Animal Whisperer (deep connection), and Social Butterfly (community-focused)."

**Claude:**
> "Love these! A few more questions:
>
> 1. Should we store quiz results in the database for analytics?
> 2. Track UTM parameters for marketing campaigns?
> 3. What's the CTA after seeing results?"

**You:**
> "Yes to database storage—we want lead analytics. Track UTM params. CTA should be 'Create Your Profile' linking to our onboarding flow, plus a 'Share Result' button."

**Claude:**
> "Got it. Let me create comprehensive specs for this quiz..."

### Generated Specs Files

Claude creates `specs/quiz-requirements.md`:

```markdown
# BUILDING MODE

You are in BUILDING mode. Implement tasks from the plan.

## Your Task Loop
For each iteration:
1. Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and progress.txt
2. Pick the highest priority task with status: pending
3. Study existing code patterns in the project
4. Implement the feature completely
5. Run: npm run lint (if available)
6. When implementation is complete:
   - Commit: "feat(quiz): description"
   - Update task status to completed
   - Append to progress.txt with timestamp

## Critical Rules
- ONE task at a time
- Match existing code patterns and conventions
- Use existing UI components from components/ui/
- Use path aliases (@/) for imports
- Each commit must be atomic and working

Output "ALL TASKS COMPLETE" when all tasks have status: completed.
```

## Handling Errors (What Went Wrong)

Ralph hit a couple of snags. Here's how they were resolved:

### Error 1: Missing Import (Iteration 9)

**Error:**
```
[Iteration 9] Lint error...
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/convex/_generated/api'
```

**What happened:** Ralph tried to import from Convex before the types were generated.

**How Ralph fixed it:**
```
[Iteration 10] Detected missing Convex types
[Iteration 10] This is expected - types generate on dev server start
[Iteration 10] Import is correct, marking task complete
```

**Learning:** Ralph understood this was a development environment issue, not a code bug.

### Error 2: State Update Logic (Iteration 12)

**Error:**
```
[Iteration 12] Quiz not advancing to next question...
Previous button disabled when it shouldn't be
```

**What happened:** State update timing issue with React's batching.

**How Ralph fixed it:**
```
[Iteration 13] Analyzing state flow...
[Iteration 13] Issue: checking index before state update completes
[Iteration 13] Fix: use callback form of setState and memoize handlers
[Iteration 13] Quiz navigation working correctly
```

**Solution Ralph implemented:**

```typescript
// Before (problematic)
const handleNext = () => {
  setCurrentQuestionIndex(currentQuestionIndex + 1);
  // Bug: checking old value
};

// After (fixed)
const handleNext = useCallback(() => {
  if (isLastQuestion) {
    // handle completion
  } else {
    setCurrentQuestionIndex((prev) => prev + 1);
  }
}, [isLastQuestion]);
```

## Testing the Quiz

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# In another terminal:
npm run convex:dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/quiz` and try it out:

1. Answer all 6 questions
2. Enter your email (or skip)
3. See your personality result
4. Click "Share Result" to test sharing
5. Check Convex dashboard for the lead data

## Key Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Real project context**: Building for an actual platform meant realistic requirements and patterns
2. **Existing UI components**: Ralph leveraged shadcn/ui components already in the project
3. **Clear scoring system**: Weighted scoring was well-defined in specs, making implementation straightforward
4. **Atomic tasks**: Each component was a single task, allowing clean commits
5. **Pattern matching**: Ralph picked up on existing code conventions automatically

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Test coverage**: We didn't include test requirements—next time add unit tests for scoring logic
2. **Accessibility audit**: Should verify screen reader experience
3. **Analytics events**: Could add PostHog tracking for funnel analysis

### Time Comparison

**Traditional Development:**
- Data models: 1 hour
- Convex setup: 30 minutes
- Components (4): 4-5 hours
- Page + routing: 1 hour
- Styling polish: 1-2 hours
- Debugging: 1-2 hours
- **Total: 8-12 hours**

**With Ralph Wiggum:**
- Requirements conversation: 25 minutes
- Planning mode: 8 minutes
- Building mode (autonomous): 2 hours 23 minutes
- Review and testing: 15 minutes
- **Total human time: 48 minutes**
- **Total elapsed time: 3 hours**

**Productivity multiplier: ~10x**

## What's Next

You just watched Ralph build a complete marketing feature—8 tasks, 15 commits, 2.5 hours of autonomous work. And it's not some tutorial throwaway. It's live, capturing leads, generating revenue.

That's the power of the Three-Phase Methodology in action.

But what happens when things go really wrong? When Ralph gets stuck in a loop? When the tests keep failing? When you're debugging at 2 AM because you need this feature shipped?

In [Part 5: Advanced Patterns and Troubleshooting](/blog/ralph-wiggum-part-5-advanced-troubleshooting), we cover the hard stuff: debugging stuck loops, complex multi-repo projects, enterprise patterns, and the edge cases that separate Ralph practitioners from Ralph masters.

## Live Demo

Try the quiz yourself: [What Type of Pet Sitter Are You?](https://www.globalpetsitter.com/quiz)

Ralph built this. It's in production. It's capturing leads right now.

{/* IMAGE: Screenshot of the live quiz with "Your result: Animal Whisperer" displayed */}

<QuickReference>

**Setup** — `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`

**Phase 1** — Define requirements with Claude (creates `specs/*.md`)

**Phase 2** — `/ralph-loop "$(cat PROMPT_plan.md)" --max-iterations 5 --completion-promise "PLAN COMPLETE"`

**Phase 3** — `/ralph-loop "$(cat PROMPT_build.md)" --max-iterations 30 --completion-promise "ALL TASKS COMPLETE"`

**Monitor** — `ralph-tui run` (separate terminal)

**Check progress** — `cat progress.txt` and `git log --oneline`

**Key takeaways**

Real projects work better than toy examples—Ralph picks up your existing patterns

BuzzFeed quizzes are perfect Ralph projects (clear completion, testable outcomes)

`progress.txt` shows Ralph's thinking—invaluable for debugging

Small errors get fixed autonomously in the next iteration

Git history from Ralph is clean and atomic

ROI: ~$5 in usage for 8+ hours of saved development time
