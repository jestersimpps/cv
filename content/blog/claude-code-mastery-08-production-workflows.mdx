You've been using Claude Code locally—commands, skills, subagents, MCP servers. It's transformed how you work. But what about when you're not at your terminal? What about your team?

Claude Code's GitHub integration lets you @mention Claude directly in issues and PRs. Your team can get AI assistance without everyone installing anything locally. And with GitHub Actions, Claude can review every PR automatically.

## The GitHub Integration

With a simple `@claude` mention in any PR or issue, Claude can:

- **Analyze code** — Review PRs, explain changes, find issues
- **Create pull requests** — Implement features from issue descriptions
- **Fix bugs** — Investigate, identify root cause, submit patches
- **Answer questions** — Explain codebase patterns and architecture
- **Follow your standards** — Uses your CLAUDE.md conventions

All of this happens asynchronously. You mention `@claude`, go grab coffee, and come back to a PR or detailed analysis.

## Installation

The easiest setup is through Claude Code itself:

```bash
Claude
/install-github-app
```

This command guides you through:

1. Installing the Claude GitHub App on your repository
2. Authorizing the required permissions
3. Setting up the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret

You need repository admin access to complete installation.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual configuration:

1. **Create the workflow file** at `.github/workflows/claude.yml`:

```yaml
Name: Claude Code Assistant

On:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]

Permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

Jobs:
  claude:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

2. **Add your API key**: Repository Settings → Secrets → Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

3. **Commit and push** the workflow file

## @claude Mentions

Once installed, mention `@claude` in any issue or PR to trigger assistance.

### In Issues

```
@claude implement this feature following our auth patterns
```

Claude analyzes the issue, creates a plan, and opens a PR with the implementation.

```
@claude investigate why users are seeing timeout errors in the checkout flow
```

Claude explores the codebase, identifies potential causes, and reports findings.

### In Pull Requests

```
@claude review this PR for security issues
```

Claude analyzes the diff, comments on specific lines, and provides a summary.

```
@claude explain why this approach was chosen over using a state machine
```

Claude reads the changes, understands the context, and explains the reasoning.

### In PR Comments

```
@claude can you refactor this to use async/await instead of callbacks?
```

Claude updates the code and pushes a new commit to the PR.

```
@claude add tests for the edge cases you identified
```

Claude writes and commits the additional tests.

## Workflow Triggers

Configure when Claude activates:

### Comment-Triggered (Interactive)

```yaml
On:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
```

Claude responds to `@claude` mentions in comments. Most flexible—team members trigger it when needed.

### PR-Triggered (Automatic Review)

```yaml
On:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
```

Claude automatically reviews every new PR and when new commits are pushed. Add a prompt to specify what to look for:

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    prompt: "Review this PR for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and adherence to our coding standards"
```

### Issue-Triggered (Auto-Triage)

```yaml
On:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]
```

Claude can triage new issues, add labels, or start implementation when specific labels are applied.

### Scheduled (Maintenance)

```yaml
On:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 9 AM
```

Run maintenance tasks: dependency updates, documentation refresh, codebase health checks.

## Production Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Dual-Loop Review

Combine automated checks with AI review:

```yaml
Jobs:
  automated-checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run typecheck
      - run: npm run test

  ai-review:
    needs: automated-checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            Review this PR for:
            1. Logic errors the linter wouldn't catch
            2. Architecture and design concerns
            3. Performance implications
            4. Missing edge cases

            Automated checks already passed. Focus on higher-level review.
```

**Why it works:** Linters catch syntax issues. Claude catches design problems. Together, they're comprehensive.

### Pattern 2: Spec-Driven Development

Structure your workflow from requirements to implementation:

```
1. Requirements Phase
   └── Create detailed issue with acceptance criteria
   └── @claude to create implementation plan
   └── Review and refine plan

2. Implementation Phase
   └── Approve plan → Claude creates PR
   └── Automated tests run
   └── Human review

3. Merge Phase
   └── Final approval
   └── Merge and deploy
```

**Example issue:**

```markdown
## Feature: User Export

### Requirements
- Export user data as CSV or JSON
- Include: name, email, signup date, last login
- Admins only
- Max 10,000 records per export

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Export button on admin dashboard
- [ ] Format selection (CSV/JSON)
- [ ] Progress indicator for large exports
- [ ] Download link sent via email for exports > 1000 records

@claude implement this following our existing export patterns in src/exports/
```

### Pattern 3: Bug Fix Pipeline

Streamlined bug investigation and fixing:

```markdown
## Bug: Checkout fails for international addresses

### Reproduction
1. Add item to cart
2. Enter shipping address with non-US country
3. Click "Continue to Payment"
4. Error: "Invalid address format"

### Expected
Checkout should accept international addresses

@claude investigate and fix this bug
```

Claude will:
1. Analyze the codebase for address handling
2. Identify the root cause
3. Create a PR with the fix
4. Add tests for international addresses

### Pattern 4: Path-Specific Reviews

Trigger different review depth based on what changed:

```yaml
Jobs:
  security-review:
    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.changed_files, 'auth/') ||
        contains(github.event.pull_request.changed_files, 'payments/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            CRITICAL SECURITY REVIEW

            This PR modifies authentication or payment code.
            Perform a thorough security audit:
            - Check for injection vulnerabilities
            - Verify authentication/authorization
            - Look for data exposure risks
            - Validate input sanitization

            Flag any concerns for human review before merge.
```

## Team Configuration

### Shared CLAUDE.md for Teams

Your project's CLAUDE.md is used by both local Claude Code and GitHub Actions. Include team-specific instructions:

> **Important:** When you @mention Claude on GitHub, it automatically reads your project's [CLAUDE.md configuration from Part 3](/blog/claude-code-mastery-03-project-configuration#claudemd-your-projects-memory) to understand your team's standards, conventions, and restrictions.

```markdown
# Team Project Standards

## @claude Triggers
When responding to GitHub mentions:
- `@claude review` - Full code review with security focus
- `@claude implement` - Create PR from issue description
- `@claude fix` - Investigate and patch bugs
- `@claude explain` - Explain code or architecture decisions
- `@claude triage` - Analyze and label new issues

## PR Requirements
- All PRs require passing tests before Claude review
- Security-critical changes require human approval
- Database migrations require team lead review

## Coding Conventions
[Your existing coding standards...]

## Restricted Areas
Do not automatically modify:
- config/production.json - Requires manual review
- database/migrations/ - Requires team lead approval
- src/auth/ - Security-critical, flag for review
- src/payments/ - PCI compliance, flag for review
```

### Permission Boundaries

Configure what Claude can and cannot do:

```yaml
Permissions:
  contents: read        # Can read files
  pull-requests: write  # Can comment on PRs
  issues: write         # Can comment on issues
  # Note: Cannot merge PRs without additional config
```

**Always require human approval for merges.** Claude can review, suggest, and even commit—but a human should click the merge button.

![Change my mind meme - Claude should auto-merge PRs without human review](/assets/blog/production-change-my-mind.jpg)

## Authentication Options

### Direct API (Recommended)

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

Most straightforward. You pay per-token through your Anthropic account.

### Amazon Bedrock

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    provider: bedrock
    aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws_region: us-east-1
```

For enterprise environments with AWS infrastructure.

### Google Vertex AI

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    provider: vertex
    gcp_project_id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
    gcp_region: us-central1
```

For teams on Google Cloud.

## Cost Management

GitHub Actions usage + API tokens can add up. Monitor and control costs:

### Set Token Limits

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    max_tokens: 4096
```

### Limit Trigger Frequency

```yaml
On:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]  # Only on open, not on every push
    paths:
      - 'src/**'     # Only when source files change
      - '!**.md'     # Ignore documentation changes
```

### Use Labels as Gates

```yaml
On:
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled]

Jobs:
  claude-review:
    if: github.event.label.name == 'needs-ai-review'
```

Only trigger when a specific label is applied.

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Instructions

```
# Vague (worse results)
@claude review this

# Specific (better results)
@claude review this PR for SQL injection vulnerabilities
In the new user search endpoint, focusing on the query
Construction in src/api/users.ts
```

### 2. Provide Context

```
@claude implement this feature

This should follow the same patterns as our existing
Export functionality in src/exports/. Use the ExportJob
Queue for async processing like we do for report generation.
```

### 3. Iterate and Refine

Treat Claude like a junior developer who benefits from feedback:

```
@claude that's close, but we need to handle the case
Where the user has no email address. Can you add a
Fallback to use their username instead?
```

### 4. Document Team Commands

Create a team reference for @claude usage:

```markdown
## Team @claude Commands Reference

- `@claude review` — Full code review — Use on all PRs
- `@claude security` — Security-focused review — Use on auth/payment changes
- `@claude implement` — Create implementation — Use on feature issues
- `@claude fix` — Investigate and patch — Use on bug issues
- `@claude explain` — Explain code/decisions — Use for onboarding, complex PRs
```

> **Note:** For organizing team-wide custom commands that work locally (not just in GitHub), see [Global vs Project Commands in Part 4](/blog/claude-code-mastery-04-custom-commands#global-vs-project-commands).

### 5. Protect Sensitive Code

Configure Claude to flag rather than modify critical areas:

```markdown
## In CLAUDE.md

When reviewing or implementing changes that touch:
- src/auth/
- src/payments/
- config/production.json
- database/migrations/

DO NOT make changes directly. Instead:
1. Flag the file as security-critical
2. Describe what changes would be needed
3. Request human review before any modifications
```

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Doesn't Respond to Mentions

1. Check the workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/claude.yml`
2. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret is set
3. Check Actions tab for workflow run logs
4. Ensure issue_comment trigger is configured

### Response is Cut Off

Token limits may be too low. Increase `max_tokens` in the action config.

### Claude Makes Wrong Assumptions

Add more context to CLAUDE.md or be more specific in your mention.

### High Costs

- Use label-gated triggers instead of automatic on every PR
- Limit to specific file paths
- Reduce max_tokens
- Use Haiku for simple tasks, Opus for complex ones
