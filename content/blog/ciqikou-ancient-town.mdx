Some places feel like they exist in two times at once. Ciqikou (磁器口, Cíqìkǒu) is one of them — a thousand-year-old porcelain trading town that somehow thrives in the shadow of Chongqing's endless skyscrapers.

## The Steps

The first thing you notice is the stairs. Ciqikou is built into the hillside, and everything here tilts. Weathered stone steps wind between wooden buildings, draped with red ribbons and prayer flags that flutter in the winter haze. The city's modern skyline looms in the distance, a reminder that this ancient street exists as an island in a sea of concrete and glass.

The architecture here dates back to the Ming and Qing dynasties — dark wooden beams, grey brick walls, and curved tile roofs that seem to defy gravity as they stack up the hillside. But look closer and you'll see lanterns strung between buildings, LED signs advertising street food, and the occasional WiFi router tucked behind a carved wooden lattice.

## Fire and Spice

A massive phoenix sculpture marks the entrance to the food street — fitting for a city obsessed with fire and spice. 非常好吃 (fēicháng hǎochī) — "extremely delicious" — the signs promise, and the air backs them up with the smell of grilled meats, numbing Sichuan peppercorns, and something sweet caramelizing somewhere nearby.

The crowd moves slowly, everyone stopping to photograph the same things — the phoenix, a particularly photogenic shopfront, a vendor pulling taffy into impossibly thin strands. Ciqikou has been a tourist destination for decades now, maybe even losing some of its authenticity along the way. But there's something honest about a place that doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: a beautiful old street where people come to eat, shop, and take pictures.

## Old and New

What strikes me most is the contrast. Traditional wooden buildings with intricate carvings sit directly beneath glass-and-steel towers. Monks in saffron robes pass teenagers in streetwear. An old man sells handmade bamboo crafts while his neighbor hawks phone cases.

Chongqing doesn't try to hide its contradictions. It lets the old and new exist together, sometimes awkwardly, sometimes beautifully. Ciqikou is the perfect example — preserved but not frozen, commercial but not soulless. It's a place where a thousand years of history is still, somehow, part of daily life.

Tomorrow: more Chongqing, more stairs, probably more spice.
