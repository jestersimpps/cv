i built a custom claude code skill that turns writing blog posts from a 30-minute chore into a 30-second command

## the problem

every time i wanted to write about a project, i'd go through the same tedious steps:
- find screenshots in the project folder
- copy them to the blog assets directory
- create a new mdx file with the right frontmatter
- write the content
- remember the correct category and tag format
- commit everything
- start the dev server to preview

it's not hard. but it's friction. and friction kills momentum

## claude code skills 101

skills live in `~/.claude/skills/` as markdown files. each file defines a slash command that claude code can execute. the structure is simple:

```
~/.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md          # global instructions
└── skills/
    ├── blog.md        # /blog command
    ├── rewrite.md     # /rewrite command
    ├── tweet.md       # /tweet command
    └── commit.md      # /commit command
```

when you type `/blog` in claude code, it loads the corresponding skill file and follows the instructions

## anatomy of a skill

here's the structure of my blog skill:

```markdown
# Blog Post Skill

Create a new blog post for jocv.dev about a project or topic.

## Usage
/blog [project-folder-or-topic]

## Arguments
- $ARGUMENTS: path to a project folder or a topic to write about

## Instructions

### 1. Determine the Subject
- Parse $ARGUMENTS to get the project folder or topic
- If a folder path is provided, explore it to understand:
  - What the project does (check README, package.json, main source files)
  - Key features and technologies used
  - Any screenshots or images in the repo

### 2. Find Images
- Search the project folder for potential cover images:
  - Look in: `/public`, `/assets`, `/images`, `/screenshots`
  - File types: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif`
- Copy the best image to `/path/to/blog/public/assets/blog/`

### 3. Write the Blog Post Content
- Create an outline based on:
  - What problem does this project solve?
  - How does it work?
  - Key features or interesting technical decisions
- Use the `/rewrite` skill to convert to personal style

### 4. Create the MDX File
- Location: `/path/to/blog/content/blog/`
- Filename: kebab-case based on topic
- Include frontmatter with title, description, date, category, tags
```

the key thing here is `$ARGUMENTS`. this is how you pass input to a skill. whatever comes after `/blog` gets injected there

## chaining skills together

the blog skill calls another skill: `/rewrite`. this converts my drafts into my writing style

```markdown
# Rewrite Skill

## Instructions
1. Parse the text from $ARGUMENTS
2. Rewrite using the style guide below
3. Show the rewritten version

## Style Guide
- start with lowercase
- use "i" not "I"
- no ending punctuation
- short, direct sentences
- stream of consciousness flow
```

skills calling skills. it's composable automation

## the execution flow

when i run `/blog ~/Sites/hyperscalper`:

```
1. claude code loads ~/.claude/skills/blog.md
2. $ARGUMENTS = "~/Sites/hyperscalper"
3. claude explores the folder:
   - reads README.md
   - checks package.json for dependencies
   - scans src/ for main functionality
4. finds images in ~/Sites/hyperscalper/public/
5. copies best image to blog assets
6. drafts the post content
7. calls /rewrite to apply my style
8. creates content/blog/building-hyperscalper.mdx
9. runs: git add . && git commit -m "add hyperscalper blog post"
10. runs: npm run dev (if not running)
11. opens http://localhost:3000/blog/building-hyperscalper
```

all from one command

## the mdx output

the skill knows exactly what frontmatter my blog needs:

```yaml

title: "Building Hyperscalper"
description: "a real-time trading dashboard for crypto markets"
publishedAt: "2026-01-13"
author: "Jo Vinkenroye"
category: "Development"
tags: ["Trading", "Crypto", "Real-time", "Next.js"]
coverImage: "/assets/blog/hyperscalper-cover.png"
featured: false
---
```

categories, tags, image paths. all defined in the skill so i don't have to remember

## the meta part

this post was written using the skill i'm writing about. /blog about the blog skill :D

## building your own

start simple. create `~/.claude/skills/your-skill.md` with:

```markdown
# Your Skill Name

Description of what it does.

## Usage
/your-skill [arguments]

## Instructions
1. First step
2. Second step
3. ...
```

think about what you do repeatedly:
- reviewing prs → `/review` skill with your checklist
- setting up projects → `/init` skill with your preferred stack
- writing docs → `/docs` skill with your format
- posting updates → `/tweet` skill with your voice

## the stack

my blog runs on next.js 14 with mdx. posts are just files:

```
content/blog/
├── automating-blog-posts.mdx
├── building-hyperscalper.mdx
└── ...
```

no database. no cms. just markdown and git. the skill writes directly to the repo

## what's next

i'm thinking about adding:
- `/imagen` integration for auto-generating cover images
- pulling in relevant code snippets automatically
- cross-posting to dev.to with `/crosspost`

but for now, it's already saving me time and—more importantly—removing the friction that stopped me from writing in the first place
