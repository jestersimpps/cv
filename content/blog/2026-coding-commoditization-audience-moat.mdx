You probably found this blog through linkedin or x

That's the point. i've been shipping weekend projects for years - trading bots, nft marketplaces, ios apps, garmin watchfaces, e-commerce platforms, language learning tools. most fail. some stick. but they all get me excited

The problem? i was building in silence

I'd spend three months on a project, launch to zero users, then move on to the next thing. rinse and repeat. the code was there. the products worked. but nobody knew they existed

Then i started noticing the building in public trend

## What Changed in 2025

Something clicked when i saw the numbers

[82% of developers now use ai tools to write code](https://www.netcorpsoftwaredevelopment.com/blog/ai-generated-code-statistics). microsoft and google announced that [a quarter of their code is ai-generated](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/15/1128352/rise-of-ai-coding-developers-2026/). [cursor went from zero to 18% market share in 18 months](https://axis-intelligence.com/ai-coding-assistants-2026-enterprise-guide/)

The thing i spent years mastering - writing clean, efficient code - became a commodity almost overnight

Here's what i realized: the code i write matters less than the people who care about it

### The Research That Convinced Me

I went deep on this. read everything i could find about ai coding tools, indie hacker success stories, and the economics of building in public

The data was clear:

**Code is commoditizing fast**
- [Github copilot: 42% market share, 20M+ users](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2025/12/ai-assisted-coding-in-2026-how-github-copilot-cursor-and-amazon-q-are-reshaping-developer-workflows.html)
- [Open-source alternatives matching quality at free tiers](https://axis-intelligence.com/ai-coding-assistants-2026-enterprise-guide/)
- [Pricing war coming: $20/month unlimited → $0.02-0.05 per request](https://dev.to/intelligenttools_tomic_85/ai-coding-in-2026-10-predictions-2ijb)

**But audience became valuable**
- [22% of linkedin creators making significant income from their presence](https://influenceflow.io/resources/personal-brand-building-on-linkedin-the-complete-2026-guide/)
- [Indie hackers with audiences: $57K-79K from side projects in 2025](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/79k-from-side-projects-in-2025-my-year-in-review-e145b2fa95)
- [Building in public shows 7-12x better conversion than product hunt launches](https://awesome-directories.com/blog/indie-hackers-launch-strategy-guide-2025/)

The indie hackers who succeeded weren't better developers. they had people who trusted them before they launched

That hit different

## Why This Matters for Weekend Builders

I build a lot. it's what gets me excited

Some weekend i'm building a trading bot. next weekend it's an ios app. then a garmin watchface. then an e-commerce platform. i can't help it. the ideas keep coming and i love bringing them to life

But here's the pattern i kept repeating: build for three months → launch to zero users → get crickets → move to next project

The code was good. the products worked. but nobody knew they existed

That's when i saw what was happening with building in public

### The Build in Public Movement

Developers sharing their journey on x, linkedin, indie hackers. documenting failures. showing revenue numbers. asking for feedback in public

And i mean really showing numbers. scroll through x and you'll see founders posting their mrr updates

"$2.3k mrr → $2.7k mrr this month"

"from $0 to $12k mrr in 6 months"

"hit $1k mrr today. took 9 months but we're here"

At first this seemed insane. why would anyone share their revenue publicly? isn't that private? doesn't it invite copycats?

But here's what i realized: those mrr updates aren't about showing off. they're proof of work. they're saying "i'm actually building a real business, not just tweeting about ideas"

And it works. [60% of indie hackers still believe in sharing earnings and metrics](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/lifestyle/is-this-the-end-of-build-in-public-heres-why-top-indie-hackers-are-suddenly-disappearing-IhSJQBnXNuNwSuNTuz4t). but the smart ones shifted from peer-oriented to user-oriented. they weren't showing off to other builders. they were turning their audience into early adopters and evangelists

The data backed it up: [sustained community presence over months beat product hunt launches 7-12x on conversion](https://awesome-directories.com/blog/indie-hackers-launch-strategy-guide-2025/)

One founder built a simple database gui tool. nothing revolutionary. but he had 15,000 followers from years of teaching database concepts on twitter. launched to $8k mrr in the first month

Not because the product was better. because people trusted him and wanted to support his work

Meanwhile, technically superior products with zero audience launched to crickets

That's when it clicked for me

## So I'm Documenting Everything Now

Here's what i decided to do

Every weekend project gets documented. every failure gets shared. every lesson learned goes in a blog post. trading bots, ios apps, web3 experiments, ai integrations - all of it

Not because i think my projects are special. because i'm building the asset that actually matters in 2026: an audience that trusts me

### The Shift in Approach

Old approach:
- build in silence for 3 months
- launch on product hunt
- get 20 upvotes and 2 signups
- wonder what went wrong
- repeat

New approach:
- share what i'm building from day one
- document decisions and tradeoffs
- show failures and pivots
- build relationships while building products
- launch to people who already care

The code quality is the same. the products are the same. but the outcomes are completely different

### Why Weekend Projects Are Perfect for This

Here's the thing about weekend projects: they're exciting

When i'm building a new garmin watchface or experimenting with a crypto trading strategy, i'm genuinely curious about whether it'll work. that energy is real. and people connect with that

Building in public works best when you're actually excited about what you're sharing. weekend projects give me an endless stream of things to document. some work. some don't. but they're all part of the journey

And that journey is the moat

### What I'm Actually Doing

Here's my commitment: 30 minutes every morning on content

- write about what i built over the weekend
- share decisions and why i made them
- post technical deep-dives when something was interesting
- document failures and what i learned
- engage with people building similar things

That's less time than i spend on twitter doom-scrolling. but it compounds differently

Some days it feels like shouting into the void. then someone replies "this helped me" or "i'm working on something similar" and i realize the network is building

### The Economics Make Sense

Here's the math that convinced me to start

Old pattern (building in silence):
- 3 months building hyperscalper
- launch on product hunt
- 47 upvotes, 12 signups
- spend 6 months trying to get users
- never hits $1k mrr

New pattern (building in public):
- document hyperscalper build from week one
- share architecture decisions on linkedin
- post technical challenges on x
- launch to audience that watched me build it
- 100+ signups day one from people who already trust it

The code is identical. the distribution isn't

That's why [indie hackers with audiences made $57K-79K in 2025](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/79k-from-side-projects-in-2025-my-year-in-review-e145b2fa95). not better code. better distribution

## What I'm Sharing and Where

I'm keeping it simple. pick a few platforms and show up consistently

### My Content Pillars

I'm focusing on what i actually know and what gets me excited:

- **Weekend project updates** - what i'm building, why, and how it's going
- **Technical deep-dives** - architecture decisions, tradeoffs, bugs i shipped
- **AI integration patterns** - real lessons from building with claude, gpt, imagen
- **Trading/crypto infrastructure** - what i learned building hyperscalper and trading bots
- **Career observations** - navigating the shift to ai-assisted development

No corporate speak. no "10 tips" listicles. just real experiences from actually building things

### Where I'm Showing Up

**This blog** - deep-dives into projects. technical breakdowns. lessons learned. everything too long for social media

**X/Twitter** - quick updates. wins and failures. asking for feedback. building relationships with other indie hackers

**LinkedIn** - polished-ish posts about career stuff. sharing blog posts. professional network building

I'm not trying to be everywhere. better to show up consistently on two platforms than sporadically on five

### What I'm Learning

Three months in and here's what i've noticed:

**Authenticity beats polish** - my most engaged posts are the messy ones. "here's what broke and how i fixed it" gets more traction than "5 tips for better code"

**Consistency matters more than quality** - posting 3 times a week with decent content beats posting once a month with perfect content. the algorithm and humans both reward showing up

**Engagement > broadcasting** - spending 30 minutes commenting on others' posts builds more connections than writing my own posts. genuine conversations create real relationships

**Process > outcomes** - people don't care that my garmin app hit 100 downloads. they care about why i built it and what i learned. the journey is more interesting than the destination

### Mistakes I've Made

**Week 1:** tried to grow on x, linkedin, indie hackers, dev.to, and hashnode simultaneously. spread too thin. now i'm focusing on x and linkedin. better to build real presence on two platforms

**Week 2:** only posted about wins. felt fake. started sharing failures. engagement went up. people connect with the struggle

**Week 3:** tried to sell my project too early. came off desperate. now i'm giving value for months before asking for anything. trust takes time

**Week 5:** debated whether to share mrr numbers. feels vulnerable. decided to wait until i actually have meaningful revenue. but i get why people do it now - it's accountability and proof you're actually shipping

**Week 8:** almost quit because growth was slow. 37 followers felt like nothing. then someone told me my post saved them 3 hours of debugging. realized the numbers don't tell the whole story

Still figuring this out. but the direction feels right

## Why You Might Want to Try This

Look, i don't know if this will work for me long-term

Maybe i'll build an audience of 10,000 people and launch products to warm leads. maybe i'll have 47 followers and feel like an idiot for sharing everything publicly

But here's what i know for sure: the old approach wasn't working

Building in silence for months. launching to crickets. wondering why nobody cared about the thing i poured my heart into. that pattern needed to break

### What I'm Betting On

The thesis is simple: in a world where ai can write code, the differentiator is knowing what to build and who needs it

Building in public helps with both:

**Knowing what to build** - when you share your ideas early, people tell you if it's stupid. saves months of building the wrong thing

**Finding who needs it** - when you document your journey, people who care about the same problems naturally find you. they're your early adopters

The skills that matter now:
- understanding user needs (talk to humans)
- making good architectural decisions (can't delegate to ai yet)
- building trust and relationships (the actual moat)
- communicating what you're building and why (distribution)

Pure coding skill? commoditized. the ability to ship code while building an audience? that might be the new rare skill

### For Weekend Builders Specifically

If you're like me - constantly starting new projects because you love building - this approach might actually work better

Most advice says "pick one thing and go deep for years." but that's not how i work. i get excited about new ideas. i want to try different tech. i like variety

Building in public turns that into an asset. every weekend project becomes content. every pivot becomes a lesson. every failure becomes a story

The portfolio of documented experiments might be more valuable than a single successful product

At least that's the bet i'm making

## The Experiment Continues

This blog is part of the experiment

Every weekend project i build gets documented here. every failure gets shared. every technical decision gets explained

Maybe this leads somewhere. maybe it doesn't

But here's what i know: the worst case is i have a portfolio of documented work that shows what i can do. the best case is i build an audience that actually cares about what i'm building

Either outcome beats building in silence and wondering why nobody knows my projects exist

### What's Next

I'm committing to this for at least a year

30 minutes every morning on content. consistent presence on x and linkedin. documenting every weekend project

The projects will keep coming. now they'll be documented

### If You're Thinking About This

Here's my advice: just start

Don't wait until you have a big audience. don't wait until you build something impressive. start documenting today

Share what you're learning. show what you're building. be honest about what's not working

The first 100 followers are the hardest. but you don't need thousands of followers to make this worth it. you need a few people who actually care

Start building your moat while you build your products

Because in 2026, code is cheap but trust is expensive

And trust takes time to build
