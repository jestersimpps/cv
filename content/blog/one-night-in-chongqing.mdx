Sometimes you land in a city and it immediately rewires your brain. Chongqing did that to me.

I arrived expecting spicy food and steep hills. What I found was a neon-drenched vertical metropolis that feels like it was designed by the Blade Runner art department — if they had a thing for red lanterns and Sichuan peppercorns.

## The Mountain City After Dark

Chongqing earns its nickname. The city is built on mountains at the confluence of two rivers, which means everything is vertical. Street level is a suggestion. You can enter a building on the 10th floor and exit at ground level.

At night, the verticality becomes spectacle. The famous Hongyadong complex — an 11-story structure of traditional stilted architecture built into the cliff face — glows like something out of Spirited Away. Cruise boats drift past, their LED displays reflecting off the Jialing River. The Qiansimen Bridge spans it all in illuminated red.

## Dinner at a Century-Old Restaurant

I found my way to 徐鼎盛 (Xú Dǐng Shèng), a restaurant that's been serving Chongqing cuisine since 1917. Over a hundred years of perfecting the same recipes.

The star of the show: 辣子鸡 (làzǐjī) — Chongqing's famous laziji. Crispy fried chicken buried under a mountain of dried chilies and Sichuan peppercorns. You fish out the chicken pieces like treasure hunting. The numbing, burning, addictive heat is unlike anything else.

Paired with local beer, stir-fried greens, and peanuts with scallions. Simple. Perfect.

## Cyberpunk Reality

Walking through Jiefangbei after dinner felt like stepping into a video game. Giant LED screens wrap around buildings. K-pop idols smile from curved displays. The contrast between traditional architecture and aggressive modernity is jarring and beautiful.

And then there's the future stuff. Robot baristas making your drinks while you watch.

Traditional wooden buildings with red lanterns sit directly below gleaming skyscrapers. It's the kind of juxtaposition that makes you understand why Chongqing has become a favorite of travel photographers and cyberpunk enthusiasts alike.

## Inside Hongyadong

Hongyadong isn't just a facade — inside, it's a labyrinth. Winding corridors open into cave-like spaces with artificial stalactites, neon food stalls, and the constant buzz of locals grabbing late-night snacks. The 好吃街 (Hǎochī Jiē — "Delicious Street") lives up to its name.

## The Guotai Arts Center

One building stopped me in my tracks: the Guotai Arts Center. Red steel beams explode outward like a frozen firework, or traditional Chinese brackets gone wild. At night, each beam is lit, creating a structure that looks simultaneously ancient and alien.

Even the landscaping is extra. Trees wrapped in lights, LED flowers blooming between branches. Everything is designed to glow.

Chongqing isn't trying to be Shanghai or Beijing. It's aggressively itself — loud, spicy, vertical, and unapologetically extra.

I'll be back.
