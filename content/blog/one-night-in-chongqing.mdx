Landed expecting spicy food and steep hills. got a vertical metropolis designed by the Blade Runner art department — if they had a thing for red lanterns and Sichuan peppercorns

## The Mountain City

Chongqing earns its nickname. built on mountains at the confluence of two rivers. everything is vertical. street level is a suggestion. enter a building on the 10th floor, exit at ground level. the GPS gives up and cries

At night the verticality becomes spectacle. 洪崖洞 (Hóngyádòng) — eleven stories of traditional stilted architecture built into the cliff face — glows like Spirited Away made real. cruise boats drift past. the Qiansimen Bridge spans it all in illuminated red

## 徐鼎盛

Dinner at **徐鼎盛 (Xú Dǐng Shèng)** — been serving Chongqing cuisine since 1917. over a hundred years of perfecting the same recipes. the kind of place where your grandparents ate the exact same dishes

The star: 辣子鸡 (làzǐjī). Chongqing's famous laziji. crispy fried chicken buried under a mountain of dried chilies and Sichuan peppercorns. you fish out the chicken pieces like treasure hunting. numbing, burning, addictive. your lips go numb. you don't stop

Local beer. stir-fried greens. peanuts with scallions. simple and perfect

## Cyberpunk Reality

Walking through 解放碑 (Jiěfàngbēi) after dinner felt like stepping into a video game. giant LED screens wrap around buildings. K-pop idols smile from curved displays. anime characters taller than apartment blocks

And then there's the future stuff. robot baristas making your drinks while you watch

Traditional wooden buildings with red lanterns sit directly below gleaming skyscrapers. cyberpunk wasn't a warning. it was a travel brochure

## Inside Hongyadong

Hongyadong isn't just a facade. inside it's a labyrinth — winding corridors, cave-like spaces with artificial stalactites, neon food stalls, the constant buzz of locals grabbing late-night snacks

好吃街 (Hǎochī Jiē) — "Delicious Street." lives up to its name

## The Guotai Arts Center

One building stopped me cold. 国泰艺术中心 (Guótài Yìshù Zhōngxīn) — red steel beams exploding outward like a frozen firework, or traditional Chinese brackets gone wild. at night each beam is lit. simultaneously ancient and alien

Even the landscaping is extra. trees wrapped in lights. LED flowers blooming between branches. everything designed to glow

Chongqing isn't trying to be Shanghai or Beijing. it's aggressively itself — loud, spicy, vertical, and unapologetically extra

I'll be back tomorrow
