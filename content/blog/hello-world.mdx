I've been building software professionally since 2011. Started with VBA macros and Access databases. Now I'm shipping AI-powered apps and crypto trading terminals. Somewhere along the way, I realized I'd learned a lot of things the hard way that might be useful to others.

## What I Actually Build

My work falls into a few buckets:

**Trading & Crypto** — I built my first altcoin trading bot in 2014. Since then I've shipped copy trading platforms, NFT marketplaces, and most recently [Hyperscalper](/blog/building-hyperscalper-client-side-trading-terminal), a fully client-side trading terminal for Hyperliquid. Zero backend. Your keys never leave your browser.

**AI Integration** — Not building foundation models. Building *with* them. Language learning apps, legal document analyzers, ad creative generators. The interesting part is figuring out where AI adds value and where it's just hype.

**Enterprise Architecture** — I spent 3+ years at AWV transforming a maintenance nightmare into a proper monorepo with 8 Angular apps. Also architected frontend systems at Fednot. The unglamorous work that keeps large teams productive.

**Weekend Projects** — iOS apps, Garmin watchfaces, e-commerce platforms. I ship a lot. Most things fail. Some stick.

## Why Write Now

Three reasons:

**1. Writing clarifies thinking.** When I wrote the Hyperscalper deep-dive, I found bugs in my own mental model. Had to actually understand my code to explain it.

**2. Documentation for future me.** I've forgotten more architectural decisions than I remember. Writing them down means I won't have to re-learn the same lessons.

**3. The internet gave me a lot.** Stack Overflow answers, random blog posts, open source code. Time to contribute back.

## What To Expect

Technical deep-dives into things I've actually built. Tradeoffs I faced, decisions I made, bugs I shipped. No "10 Tips for Better Code" listicles. No content for content's sake.

I'll cover frontend architecture, AI integration patterns, crypto/trading infrastructure, and the occasional career observation. Probably some Swift and mobile stuff too — I've been shipping iOS apps lately.

If something I write saves you a few hours of debugging or helps you avoid a mistake I made, that's the goal.
