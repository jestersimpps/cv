I've been building software professionally since 2011. Started with VBA macros and Access databases. Now I'm shipping AI-powered apps and crypto trading terminals. Somewhere along the way, I realized the code matters less than the people who care about it.

Currently specializing in TypeScript-first architectures with **Angular/Next.js/NestJS/Convex** and exploring Web3/blockchain technologies and AI integrations. But the real focus now is building an audience while building products.

## What I Actually Build

My work falls into a few buckets:

**Trading & Crypto** — I built my first altcoin trading bot in 2014. Since then I've shipped copy trading platforms, NFT marketplaces, and most recently [Hyperscalper](/blog/building-hyperscalper-client-side-trading-terminal), a fully client-side trading terminal for Hyperliquid. Zero backend. Your keys never leave your browser.

**AI Integration** — Not building foundation models. Building *with* them. Language learning apps, legal document analyzers, ad creative generators. The interesting part is figuring out where AI adds value and where it's just hype.

**Enterprise Architecture** — I spent 3+ years at AWV transforming a maintenance nightmare into a proper monorepo with 8 Angular apps. Also architected frontend systems at Fednot. The unglamorous work that keeps large teams productive.

**Weekend Projects** — iOS apps, Garmin watchfaces, e-commerce platforms. I ship a lot. Most things fail. Some stick.

## Why Write Now

Four reasons:

**1. Code is becoming a commodity.** AI tools can generate decent code now. 82% of developers use them. The differentiator isn't writing code anymore — it's knowing what to build, who needs it, and how to reach them. Audience is the new moat.

**2. Writing clarifies thinking.** When I wrote the Hyperscalper deep-dive, I found bugs in my own mental model. Had to actually understand my code to explain it.

**3. Distribution matters more than ever.** Indie hackers with audiences made $57K-79K from side projects in 2025. Not because their code was better — because people trusted them before they launched. Building in public creates a moat that can't be cloned.

**4. The internet gave me a lot.** Stack Overflow answers, random blog posts, open source code. Time to contribute back. But now I'm also building the asset that compounds — trust, relationships, distribution.

## What To Expect

Technical deep-dives into things I've actually built. Tradeoffs I faced, decisions I made, bugs I shipped. No "10 Tips for Better Code" listicles. No content for content's sake.

I'll cover frontend architecture, AI integration patterns, crypto/trading infrastructure, and career observations about building in the age of AI. Probably some Swift and mobile stuff too — I've been shipping iOS apps lately.

The space is changing fast. AI commoditized code generation. Audience became the differentiator. I'm figuring this out in real-time and sharing what I learn.

If something I write saves you a few hours of debugging or helps you avoid a mistake I made, great. If it helps you understand why building an audience matters as much as building products, even better.
