Picture this: you're on a flight, your phone buzzes, and your AI assistant just handled a complex task you messaged it about three hours ago. No laptop. No SSH. Just results waiting in your Telegram.

That's not some premium SaaS product—it's Clawdbot running on a $6/month DigitalOcean droplet. And you can set it up in about 15 minutes.

Here's exactly how to do it.

## Why DigitalOcean?

You could run Clawdbot on any VPS, but DigitalOcean hits the sweet spot:

- **$6/month** gets you 1GB RAM and 25GB SSD—plenty for Clawdbot
- **One-click Node.js droplets** skip the dependency headaches
- **Reliable uptime** means your assistant is always available
- **Simple firewall rules** keep things locked down

No affiliate links here. It just works.

## Step 1: Create Your Droplet

Head to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) and create a new Droplet.

**Choose your config:**

- **Region:** Wherever you are (lower latency = faster responses)
- **Image:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Size:** Basic → Regular → $6/mo (1 GB RAM, 1 vCPU)
- **Authentication:** SSH keys (please, not password)

Hit Create and wait 60 seconds.

## Step 2: SSH In and Install Node.js 22

Once your droplet is live, SSH in:

```bash
ssh root@your-droplet-ip
```

Clawdbot needs Node.js 22+. The fastest way:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Verify it worked:

```bash
node -v
# Should show v22.x.x
```

## Step 3: Install Clawdbot

One command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
```

This installs Clawdbot globally and kicks off the onboarding wizard. The wizard will ask you a few questions:

- **API provider:** Pick Anthropic (Claude) or OpenAI
- **API key:** Paste your key
- **Install daemon:** Say yes—this keeps Clawdbot running after you disconnect

If you accidentally skipped onboarding:

```bash
clawdbot onboard --install-daemon
```

## Step 4: Connect Telegram

Now the fun part. You need a Telegram bot token:

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Pick a name and username (must end in `bot`)
4. Copy the API token BotFather gives you

Add it to your config:

```bash
nano ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json
```

Find (or add) the `channels` section:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

Save and restart:

```bash
clawdbot gateway restart
```

## Step 5: Pair Your Account

Clawdbot uses a pairing system so random people can't spam your bot. Message your bot on Telegram—you'll get a pairing code.

Back on your droplet:

```bash
clawdbot pairing approve telegram YOUR_CODE
```

That's it. You're connected.

## Step 6: Verify Everything Works

Check the status:

```bash
clawdbot status
```

You should see the Gateway running and Telegram connected. Send a message to your bot—you should get a response within seconds.

If something's wrong:

```bash
clawdbot health
clawdbot gateway logs
```

## Making It Production-Ready

A few tweaks for long-term reliability:

**Enable automatic updates:**

```bash
apt-get install unattended-upgrades
dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades
```

**Set up a firewall:**

```bash
ufw allow OpenSSH
ufw enable
```

You don't need to open any other ports—Clawdbot connects outbound to Telegram's servers.

**Monitor with DigitalOcean:**

Enable Droplet metrics in your DO dashboard. Set up an alert if CPU stays above 80% for 5 minutes (usually means something's stuck).

## What Can You Do Now?

Your AI assistant is live 24/7. Some ideas:

- **Research on the go:** "Summarize the latest news about [topic]"
- **Code reviews:** Send a file, ask for feedback
- **Reminders:** "Remind me in 2 hours to check the deployment"
- **Web searches:** "Find the best restaurants in [city]"
- **Anything Claude/GPT can do**—but from your pocket

The real power comes when you set up a workspace with custom instructions. But that's a topic for another post.

## Key Takeaways

- **$6/month** gets you a personal AI assistant on Telegram
- **15 minutes** from zero to working setup
- **No maintenance** once the daemon is running
- **Pairing system** keeps your bot private
- **SSH keys only**—don't be that person with password auth
