## The Only Thing Left

Let me be direct: the difference between developers who master Ralph and those who don't isn't incremental. It's a fundamentally different paradigm.

While some developers are still manually prompting, reviewing, prompting, reviewing—others are defining requirements, starting loops, and going to sleep. They wake up to working features.

You've read the series. You have the methodology. You have the resources.

Now it's on you.
