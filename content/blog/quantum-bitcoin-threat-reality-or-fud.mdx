Christopher Wood just dropped his entire Bitcoin allocation.

The widely-followed Wall Street strategist at Jefferies—whose "Greed and Fear" newsletter moves markets—pulled Bitcoin from his model portfolio this week. His reason? Quantum computing.

He's replacing BTC with gold. The kind you can hold. The kind that doesn't care about Shor's algorithm.

This comes after Coinbase's head of research suggested **33% of Bitcoin's supply** could be vulnerable to quantum attacks. Bankless went further, saying quantum could "divide Bitcoin by zero."

So is this the end? Or is it FUD?

Let's break it down.

## What Quantum Actually Threatens

First, some technical clarity. Bitcoin relies on two cryptographic primitives:

1. **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)** — Used to sign transactions. This proves you own the private key without revealing it.

2. **SHA-256** — Used for mining (proof of work) and creating addresses from public keys.

Quantum computers threaten these differently.

### ECDSA: The Real Risk

Shor's algorithm, running on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, could theoretically derive a private key from a public key in polynomial time. Today's classical computers would take longer than the age of the universe for the same task.

The key word is "theoretically." We'll get to why.

Here's the attack scenario:

```
1. You broadcast a transaction (reveals your public key)
2. Attacker has ~10 minutes before it's mined
3. Quantum computer derives private key from public key
4. Attacker double-spends your funds
```

This is called the "transaction interception" attack. It's real in theory, but requires:

- A quantum computer with **millions** of stable qubits
- Error correction that doesn't exist yet
- Sub-10-minute execution time

### SHA-256: Not Really at Risk

Grover's algorithm could theoretically speed up brute-force searches, but only quadratically. For SHA-256, this means reducing security from 256 bits to 128 bits.

128-bit security is still considered unbreakable by any foreseeable technology. Your addresses are safe from quantum hash attacks.

## The "33% Vulnerable" Claim

Coinbase's research noted that roughly 33% of Bitcoin's supply sits in addresses where the public key has been exposed.

This includes:

- **P2PK addresses** (original Satoshi-era format, public key is the address)
- **Addresses that have been spent from** (spending reveals the public key)
- **Lost coins** (many early addresses used P2PK)

Satoshi's estimated 1 million BTC? Sitting in P2PK addresses with exposed public keys.

**Here's what's NOT vulnerable:**

- Modern P2PKH and P2SH addresses (public key hidden behind hash)
- Addresses you've never spent from
- Any address using newer formats

If you're using a modern wallet and following best practices (fresh address per transaction), your Bitcoin isn't at risk until you spend it.

## The Timeline Problem

Here's where the FUD falls apart: **we're not close.**

Google's Willow chip, announced in late 2024, has 105 qubits. It made headlines for solving a specific benchmark problem in 5 minutes that would take classical computers 10 septillion years.

Impressive? Sure. Relevant to Bitcoin? Not really.

Breaking ECDSA-256 would require an estimated **1,500 to 4,000 logical qubits**. But logical qubits require error correction, which means you need millions of physical qubits to produce thousands of logical ones.

Current estimates:

- **Physical qubits:** ~1,000 today → need millions for BTC attack
- **Logical qubits:** ~0 today → need 1,500-4,000 for BTC attack
- **Error rates:** high today → need near-zero for BTC attack
- **Estimated timeline:** 2030-2050+ for cryptographically-relevant QC

Even quantum computing optimists don't expect cryptographically-relevant quantum computers before 2030. Most serious researchers say 2040-2050.

## What Bitcoin Can Do About It

Bitcoin has time. And options.

### 1. Post-Quantum Cryptography

NIST finalized its first post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. These include:

- **CRYSTALS-Dilithium** — Digital signatures resistant to Shor's algorithm
- **SPHINCS+** — Hash-based signatures (even more conservative)
- **CRYSTALS-Kyber** — Key encapsulation for future use

Bitcoin could soft-fork to support these new signature schemes. The community has been discussing BIP proposals for quantum resistance since 2016.

### 2. Address Format Migration

A coordinated migration to quantum-resistant addresses could protect the network. This has precedent—Bitcoin has upgraded address formats multiple times (P2PKH → P2SH → P2WPKH → P2TR).

### 3. The Nuclear Option

In an emergency, a hard fork could:

- Freeze all P2PK addresses (controversial—includes Satoshi's coins)
- Require migration to new address formats within a deadline
- Implement quantum-resistant signatures immediately

Nobody wants this option. But it exists.

## The Incentive Argument

Here's something the doomers miss: **quantum computer operators have stronger incentives to mine Bitcoin than to attack it.**

A quantum computer capable of breaking ECDSA could also find SHA-256 hashes faster (via Grover's algorithm). The first entity with such a computer could:

1. **Attack Bitcoin** — Steal some coins, destroy confidence in the network, crash the price of everything you stole
2. **Mine Bitcoin** — Earn consistent, legitimate block rewards while the network functions normally

Option 2 is obviously more profitable. You'd be killing the golden goose for a one-time meal.

## My Take

Christopher Wood is a smart guy. He's also managing other people's money and needs to account for tail risks.

For institutional allocators with fiduciary duties, "quantum might break Bitcoin someday" is a reasonable concern to flag. It's conservative risk management.

For individual holders? I think it's overblown.

The timeline is long. The solutions exist. The incentives work in Bitcoin's favor. And the 33% "vulnerable" supply includes coins that are probably lost forever anyway (including Satoshi's stash, which moving would be a bigger story than quantum computing).

**What I'm watching:**

- Progress on quantum error correction (the real bottleneck)
- Bitcoin BIPs proposing quantum-resistant upgrades
- NIST post-quantum standard adoption in other protocols

If you see a 10,000-qubit quantum computer with stable error correction, then start worrying. Until then, the bigger risk to your Bitcoin is forgetting your seed phrase.
