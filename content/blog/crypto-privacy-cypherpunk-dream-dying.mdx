Last week, Zcash creator Zuko Wilcox dropped a truth bomb on Bankless that stuck with me: crypto is on track to become the next Linux. Not in a good way.

His point? Linux set out to liberate computing for everyone. It succeeded technically — and completely failed as a movement. Today, Linux powers every server, every Android phone, every cloud instance. But 99.9% of people don't know or care. The liberation went to mega-corporations. The users got nothing.

Crypto is walking the exact same path.

## The UX Trap

The cypherpunk approach has always been: *build the technology, then teach the world to use it*. Zuko argues this has never worked. Not for PGP. Not for Tor. Not for self-hosted email. And not for crypto wallets with 24-word seed phrases.

The person who understood this best wasn't a crypto builder — it was Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of Signal. Moxie's key insight was deceptively simple: if you showed users an honest UX — one that revealed every party with access to their data (the CEO, the sysadmins, the intelligence agencies) — they'd be horrified. Signal "corrects the UX" by making encryption invisible. You see only the actual parties in the conversation. Nothing else.

Crypto hasn't had its Signal moment yet. We're still asking users to understand gas fees, manage private keys, and navigate five different bridge protocols to move tokens between chains. Meanwhile, Telegram — which crypto Twitter treats as its home base — is what Zuko bluntly calls "a freaking honeypot."

> "How dumb can crypto people be? Pavel Durov's organization receives a copy of everything typed in groups." — Zuko Wilcox

He's not wrong. The irony is painful: an industry built on trustlessness and privacy, conducting all its business on a platform with zero end-to-end encryption for groups.

## AI Is Running the Same Playbook

Here's where it gets really interesting. The Web2 exploitation cycle — free product → advertising → lock-in → extraction — isn't just history. It's happening right now with AI.

OpenAI announced ads. Google is weaving Gemini into Gmail, Calendar, and every surface it owns. The playbook is running on turbo. And the censorship is already here, unprompted.

Naomi Brockwell, a privacy-focused YouTuber, discovered that ChatGPT was actively censoring her content about privacy tools — one-time phone numbers, crypto privacy techniques — without being asked by any regulator or policy. The model just... decided these topics were problematic.

Think about that. We're building AI assistants that will mediate our entire digital lives, and they're already pre-censoring privacy tools before anyone even asked them to. This isn't a slippery slope argument. We're already at the bottom.

## The ZEC Signal

One data point that caught my eye: Zcash surged from roughly $50 to $750 in recent months (now sitting around $350). No advertising campaign. No influencer shilling. No exchange listing pump. Just organic demand.

That's a market signal worth paying attention to. When a privacy-focused asset 15x's on pure demand in a market that's otherwise bleeding out, it tells you something about what people actually want versus what the industry is building.

The broader crypto market is obsessed with speed, throughput, and DeFi yields. Meanwhile, the thing people apparently want most — financial privacy — is treated as a niche concern or, worse, something suspicious.

## The Economic Feedback Loop Problem

Zuko raised a point that I think is the most underrated observation in crypto right now: Silicon Valley wins because better products attract more money, which funds better products. It's a virtuous cycle.

Crypto has this for DeFi. More liquidity → better yields → more liquidity. It works.

But for privacy and social tools? The economics are inverted. Signal actually *loses* money with every new user. The servers cost more. The development burden grows. And there's no advertising model to offset it because — well, that would defeat the entire purpose.

This is why every "decentralized social" experiment keeps failing. Farcaster and Lens, two of the most promising attempts at decentralized social media, are both effectively throwing in the towel — getting acquired by apps within their own ecosystems. The tech worked. The economics didn't.

Zuko's proposed solution is almost comically simple:

> "My solution to all the world's problems is simple: people pay for stuff and there's open competition."

It sounds naive until you realize it's the only model that aligns incentives without requiring exploitation. You pay for Signal. You pay for your privacy chain. The builder gets revenue. Competition keeps quality high and prices fair. No ads. No data harvesting. No enshittification.

## What This Means for Builders

If you're building in crypto or AI right now, here's my take:

**Privacy is infrastructure, not a feature.** Every chain, every AI model, every messaging platform will eventually need it. The question is whether it gets bolted on (badly) or built in (properly).

**The 100-million-user bar is real.** Both Zuko and Coinbase's Brian Armstrong cite this number. Below it, you're a curiosity. Above it, you're a force. Nothing in crypto privacy is remotely close to this yet.

**AI privacy is the next frontier.** Moxie Marlinspike is reportedly building a private AI product. When the person who made encrypted messaging mainstream turns their attention to AI, pay attention. This could be the Signal moment that AI desperately needs.

**Stop building for crypto people.** The cypherpunk trap is building for yourself and your peers. If your product requires a blog post to explain, you've already lost. Build for the person who just wants their stuff to be private without thinking about it.

## The Bottom Line

We're at a weird inflection point. The crypto market is awash in capitulation sentiment. AI is eating the world but centralizing it in the process. And the one thing that could differentiate both — genuine, user-first privacy — remains an afterthought.

The Zcash founder sees it clearly: the cypherpunk dream isn't dead, but it's dying of UX poisoning. The cure isn't better cryptography. It's better products that happen to be private.

Signal proved this was possible for messaging. Someone needs to prove it for money. And someone needs to prove it for AI before Google and OpenAI make it impossible.

The clock is ticking.
