Day two in Chongqing. Different vibe entirely — trading last night's neon glow for overcast skies and daytime exploration through Yuzhong District.

## Warriors on the Hillside

The first thing that stopped me: a massive bronze sculpture of ancient Chinese warriors hauling ropes up a steep hillside. Smaller soldier figures line the slope below. Behind them? Modern high-rises and the ever-present contrast that makes this city so visually striking.

Red lanterns hang in the background. The juxtaposition never gets old here — ancient warriors frozen in struggle while delivery scooters zip past below.

## The Pagoda

A three-tier pagoda with classic upturned eaves and red lanterns. A bronze gong at the entrance. Visitors milling about the stone plaza.

The overcast sky gave everything a moody, contemplative atmosphere. No harsh shadows — just soft light on dark wood and weathered stone.

## 凉亭子 — The Cool Pavilion

Found my way to **凉亭子 (Liángtíngzi)** — literally "Cool Pavilion" — in Yuzhong's Qixinggang neighborhood. A traditional teahouse with an outdoor terrace overlooking the city.

]} />

Bamboo chairs. A massive old tree providing shade. Thatched umbrellas. A banner with 重庆 (Chongqing) calligraphy on the stone wall behind. 

The kind of place where you order a beer and accidentally lose two hours watching the city below.

Which is exactly what happened.

*More from Chongqing coming — this city keeps revealing layers.*
