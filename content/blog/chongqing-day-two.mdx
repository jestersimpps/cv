Day two in Chongqing. Trading last night's neon glow for overcast skies and a full day of wandering — from a thousand-year-old trading town to afternoon beers at a hillside teahouse.

## Ciqikou Ancient Town

Some places feel like they exist in two times at once. Ciqikou (磁器口, Cíqìkǒu) is one of them — a thousand-year-old porcelain trading town that somehow thrives in the shadow of Chongqing's endless skyscrapers.

### The Steps

The first thing you notice is the stairs. Ciqikou is built into the hillside, and everything here tilts. Weathered stone steps wind between wooden buildings, draped with red ribbons and prayer flags that flutter in the winter haze. The city's modern skyline looms in the distance, a reminder that this ancient street exists as an island in a sea of concrete and glass.

The architecture here dates back to the Ming and Qing dynasties — dark wooden beams, grey brick walls, and curved tile roofs that seem to defy gravity as they stack up the hillside.

### Fire and Spice

A massive phoenix sculpture marks the entrance to the food street — fitting for a city obsessed with fire and spice. 非常好吃 (fēicháng hǎochī) — "extremely delicious" — the signs promise.

## Yuzhong District

After Ciqikou, wandered into Yuzhong District — a different vibe entirely.

### The Ancient City Wall

Walking along the remnants of Chongqing's ancient city wall, I came across this dramatic bronze sculpture — armored warriors hauling ropes up the steep fortifications, with smaller soldier figures positioned along the slope below.

Chongqing's city walls date back to the Ming Dynasty (14th century), built to protect this strategic river confluence. The walls once wrapped around the peninsula where the Yangtze and Jialing rivers meet — a natural fortress enhanced by human engineering.

Most of the walls are gone now, demolished during modernization. But fragments remain, integrated into the hillside neighborhoods of Yuzhong District. This sculpture memorializes the soldiers who defended these walls through centuries of warfare — frozen in bronze while glass towers rise behind them.

### The Pagoda

A three-tier pagoda with classic upturned eaves and red lanterns. A bronze gong at the entrance. The overcast sky gave everything a moody, contemplative atmosphere.

## 凉亭子 — The Cool Pavilion

Found my way to **凉亭子 (Liángtíngzi)** — literally "Cool Pavilion" — in Yuzhong's Qixinggang neighborhood. A traditional teahouse with an outdoor terrace overlooking the city.

Bamboo chairs. A massive old tree providing shade. Thatched umbrellas. A banner with 重庆 (Chongqing) calligraphy on the stone wall behind.

> **做人呢，最紧要是开心**
> *Zuòrén ne, zuì jǐnyào shì kāixīn*
> "In life, the most important thing is to be happy."

The kind of place where you order a beer and accidentally lose two hours watching the city below.

Which is exactly what happened.

## 李子坝 — Liziba

No trip to Chongqing is complete without visiting **李子坝 (Lǐzǐbà)** — the station where the metro literally runs *through* a 19-story residential building. Line 2's monorail passes through floors 6-8 while people live and work above and below.

It's the kind of infrastructure solution that only makes sense in Chongqing — a city so vertical, so cramped for space, that they simply built the train through the building rather than around it. The residents reportedly don't even notice the rumble anymore.

## River Views

From a rooftop terrace at 伴山悬崖酒店 (Banshan Cliff Hotel), the view opens up — the Jialing River stretching into haze, bridges arching across, the endless skyline fading into smog.

And in the narrow gaps between apartment blocks, that same view compressed into vertical slices, framed by laundry and air conditioning units.

Chongqing in a nutshell: density, verticality, and always — always — a river view if you know where to look.
