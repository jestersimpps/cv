Day two in Chongqing. Trading last night's neon glow for overcast skies and a full day of wandering — from a thousand-year-old trading town to afternoon beers at a hillside teahouse.

## Ciqikou Ancient Town

Some places feel like they exist in two times at once. Ciqikou (磁器口, Cíqìkǒu) is one of them — a thousand-year-old porcelain trading town that somehow thrives in the shadow of Chongqing's endless skyscrapers.

### The Steps

The first thing you notice is the stairs. Ciqikou is built into the hillside, and everything here tilts. Weathered stone steps wind between wooden buildings, draped with red ribbons and prayer flags that flutter in the winter haze. The city's modern skyline looms in the distance, a reminder that this ancient street exists as an island in a sea of concrete and glass.

The architecture here dates back to the Ming and Qing dynasties — dark wooden beams, grey brick walls, and curved tile roofs that seem to defy gravity as they stack up the hillside.

### Fire and Spice

A massive phoenix sculpture marks the entrance to the food street — fitting for a city obsessed with fire and spice. 非常好吃 (fēicháng hǎochī) — "extremely delicious" — the signs promise.

## Yuzhong District

After Ciqikou, wandered into Yuzhong District — a different vibe entirely.

### The Trackers — 纤夫

A massive bronze sculpture stopped me in my tracks: men straining against ropes, hauling an invisible weight up the steep hillside.

These are **纤夫 (qiànfū)** — the Yangtze River trackers. For centuries, before steam engines and modern boats, these men pulled vessels upstream against the brutal current of the Yangtze, particularly through the treacherous Three Gorges. Teams of trackers would strap into bamboo harnesses, lean into ropes, and drag boats through rapids — often naked to avoid ruining their only clothes, sometimes slipping on wet rocks to their deaths.

It was some of the most grueling labor in human history. Chongqing, as a major river port at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, was the heart of this trade.

The sculpture captures that struggle — frozen in bronze, while delivery scooters zip past below and glass towers rise behind. Chongqing never lets you forget its past, even as it rockets into the future.

### The Pagoda

A three-tier pagoda with classic upturned eaves and red lanterns. A bronze gong at the entrance. The overcast sky gave everything a moody, contemplative atmosphere.

## 凉亭子 — The Cool Pavilion

Found my way to **凉亭子 (Liángtíngzi)** — literally "Cool Pavilion" — in Yuzhong's Qixinggang neighborhood. A traditional teahouse with an outdoor terrace overlooking the city.

Bamboo chairs. A massive old tree providing shade. Thatched umbrellas. A banner with 重庆 (Chongqing) calligraphy on the stone wall behind.

> **做人呢，最紧要是开心**
> *Zuòrén ne, zuì jǐnyào shì kāixīn*
> "In life, the most important thing is to be happy."

The kind of place where you order a beer and accidentally lose two hours watching the city below.

Which is exactly what happened.

*Chongqing keeps revealing layers. More tomorrow.*
