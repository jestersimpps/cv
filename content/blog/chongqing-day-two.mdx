Woke up to grey sky and zero plans. perfect

## Ciqikou

磁器口 (Cíqìkǒu) started as a porcelain trading post a thousand years ago. now it's a tourist trap selling spicy rabbit heads and selfie sticks. I went anyway

  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-ciqikou-2026/03-traditional-architecture.jpg", alt: "Traditional wooden buildings with grey tile roofs alongside modern high-rises" },
]} />

Stone steps worn smooth by centuries of feet. prayer ribbons tied to everything. somewhere behind the Ming dynasty rooflines, a 40-story apartment block watches over it all like a disapproving parent

  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/13-ciqikou-crowded-street.jpg", alt: "Packed crowds on Ciqikou main street with red lanterns overhead" },
]} />

A massive phoenix sculpture guards the food street. 非常好吃 (fēicháng hǎochī) plastered on every stall. "extremely delicious" — the kind of promise that's true until your stomach decides otherwise at 3am

## The Old City Wall

Yuzhong District. found the remnants of Ming dynasty walls — or rather, the bronze soldiers still defending them

<BentoGrid images={[
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/01-warrior-statue-hillside.jpg", alt: "Bronze sculpture of warriors on Chongqing's ancient city wall, modern skyline behind", span: "large" },
]} />

14th century fortifications wrapped around a peninsula where two rivers meet. most of it bulldozed for progress. what's left gets to pose for tourist photos while condos rise behind it

## 凉亭子

Found **凉亭子 (Liángtíngzi)** by accident. "Cool Pavilion" — a teahouse tucked into the hillside where old men play cards and nobody gives a shit that you're foreign

<BentoGrid images={[
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/12-teahouse-selfie.jpg", alt: "Afternoon beers with a friend at Liangtingzi teahouse", span: "wide" },
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/08-teahouse-interior.jpg", alt: "Traditional teahouse interior with wooden beams, lanterns and birdcage" },
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/03-teahouse-terrace.jpg", alt: "Outdoor teahouse terrace with bamboo furniture" },
]} />

Bamboo chairs. a tree that's probably older than your country. cold Tsingtaos. the entire city sprawled out below like it's waiting for you to figure it out

![Teahouse entrance curtain with calligraphy](/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/05-teahouse-curtain.jpg)

> **做人呢，最紧要是开心**
> *"In life, the most important thing is to be happy."*

Written on the doorway. we stayed three hours

## 李子坝

**李子坝 (Lǐzǐbà)** — the station where a monorail runs through a 19-story apartment building. floors 6-8. people live above and below. this isn't a tourist attraction they built. it's just how things are here

Chongqing ran out of horizontal space decades ago. when you can't build around something, you build through it. the residents say they don't notice the trains anymore. I believe them

## The View

Every gap between buildings here frames the same thing: river, bridge, more buildings, haze

<BentoGrid images={[
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/06-liziba-rooftop.jpg", alt: "Rooftop terrace overlooking the Jialing River and Chongqing skyline", span: "wide" },
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/07-apartment-canyon.jpg", alt: "View between apartment buildings down to the river and bridge", span: "tall" },
]} />

Laundry and AC units in the foreground. billion-dollar skyline in the back. Chongqing doesn't hide its mess. it hangs it out to dry

## After Dark

黄桷古道 (Huángjué Gǔdào) — Tang dynasty steps carved into the hillside. walked up as the sun dropped. from here, 洪崖洞 (Hóngyádòng) looks like someone stacked a village on a cliff and plugged it in

<BentoGrid images={[
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/09-hongyadong-night-view.jpg", alt: "Hongya Cave lit up at night - traditional buildings cascading down the hillside, golden lights against the dark sky", span: "wide" },
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/10-skyline-night-rooftops.jpg", alt: "Chongqing skyline at night from the old town - traditional tile roofs in foreground, modern towers and red-lit bridge across the river" },
]} />

Eleven floors of stilted wooden buildings clinging to rock. gold light bleeding out of every window. the locals call it "the real-life Spirited Away." they're not wrong

### The Bridge

Walked 东水门大桥 (Dōngshuǐmén) at night. cable-stayed, lit up, the whole city split down the middle by river

![Bridge selfie with Martijn](/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/21-bridge-selfie-night.jpg)

<BentoGrid images={[
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/16-bridge-skyline-night.jpg", alt: "Chongqing skyline at night from the bridge, golden-lit towers rising into the haze", span: "wide" },

  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/18-bridge-walk-night.jpg", alt: "Looking down the bridge deck toward the illuminated skyline" },
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/19-bridge-rainbow-lanterns.jpg", alt: "Red lanterns and rainbow LED lights along the bridge with neon skyline behind", span: "wide" },
]} />

Red lanterns on the cables. rainbow LEDs on the railings. in any other city this would be tacky. here it's just... Tuesday

### Cyberpunk Was a Documentary

They call Chongqing the cyberpunk capital of China. walked around Jiefangbei and yeah. anime girls on building-sized screens. neon grids. pink and cyan everything

<BentoGrid images={[
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/22-cyberpunk-tower.jpg", alt: "Skyscraper with neon pink and cyan grid lighting against the night sky", span: "tall" },
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/23-cyberpunk-screens.jpg", alt: "Curved building with massive anime-style LED screens and neon outlines", span: "wide" },
]} />

Blade Runner got the aesthetic right but missed the vibe. nobody here looks dystopian. they're just buying milk tea and checking their phones like the rest of us

### Susy's

Finished at **[Susy's Sky Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ndG7gL5kg93gFT4v7)**. 73rd floor. pink light. the city flattened into a circuit board below

![Cocktails](/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/11-bar-cocktails.jpg)

30 million people down there. you can't see any of them. just the lights they leave on
