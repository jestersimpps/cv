Day two in Chongqing. traded last night's neon glow for overcast skies and just wandering around all day

## Ciqikou Ancient Town

Some places feel like they exist in two times at once. Ciqikou (磁器口, Cíqìkǒu) is one of them - a thousand-year-old porcelain trading town that somehow still thrives in the shadow of endless skyscrapers

### The Steps

First thing you notice is the stairs. everything here tilts. weathered stone steps wind between wooden buildings, draped with red ribbons and prayer flags fluttering in the winter haze. the modern skyline looms in the distance, reminding you this ancient street is basically an island in a sea of concrete and glass

  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-ciqikou-2026/03-traditional-architecture.jpg", alt: "Traditional wooden buildings with grey tile roofs alongside modern high-rises" },
]} />

The architecture dates back to the Ming and Qing dynasties - dark wooden beams, grey brick walls, curved tile roofs that seem to defy gravity as they stack up the hillside

### Fire and Spice

Massive phoenix sculpture marks the entrance to the food street. fitting for a city obsessed with fire and spice. 非常好吃 (fēicháng hǎochī) - "extremely delicious" - the signs promise

## Yuzhong District

After Ciqikou, wandered into Yuzhong District. different vibe entirely

### The Ancient City Wall

Walking along remnants of the ancient city wall, came across this dramatic bronze sculpture - armored warriors hauling ropes up steep fortifications, smaller soldier figures positioned along the slope below

  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/01-warrior-statue-hillside.jpg", alt: "Bronze sculpture of warriors on Chongqing's ancient city wall, modern skyline behind", span: "large" },
]} />

Chongqing's city walls date back to the Ming Dynasty (14th century), built to protect this strategic river confluence. the walls once wrapped around the peninsula where the Yangtze and Jialing rivers meet - a natural fortress enhanced by human engineering

Most of them are gone now, demolished during modernization. but fragments remain, integrated into the hillside neighborhoods. this sculpture memorializes the soldiers who defended these walls through centuries of warfare - frozen in bronze while glass towers rise behind them

### The Pagoda

Three-tier pagoda with classic upturned eaves and red lanterns. bronze gong at the entrance. the overcast sky gave everything a moody contemplative atmosphere

## 凉亭子 — The Cool Pavilion

Found my way to **凉亭子 (Liángtíngzi)** - literally "Cool Pavilion" - in Yuzhong's Qixinggang neighborhood. traditional teahouse with an outdoor terrace overlooking the city

  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/03-teahouse-terrace.jpg", alt: "Outdoor teahouse terrace with bamboo furniture" },
]} />

Bamboo chairs. massive old tree providing shade. thatched umbrellas. a banner with 重庆 (Chongqing) calligraphy on the stone wall behind

> **做人呢，最紧要是开心**
> *Zuòrén ne, zuì jǐnyào shì kāixīn*
> "In life, the most important thing is to be happy."

The kind of place where you order a beer and accidentally lose two hours watching the city below

Which is exactly what happened :)

## 李子坝 — Liziba

No trip to Chongqing is complete without **李子坝 (Lǐzǐbà)** - the station where the metro literally runs *through* a 19-story residential building. Line 2's monorail passes through floors 6-8 while people live and work above and below

It's the kind of infrastructure solution that only makes sense in Chongqing - a city so vertical, so cramped for space, that they just built the train through the building rather than around it. the residents reportedly don't even notice the rumble anymore

## River Views

From a rooftop terrace at 伴山悬崖酒店 (Banshan Cliff Hotel), the view opens up - the Jialing River stretching into haze, bridges arching across, the endless skyline fading into smog

<BentoGrid images={[
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/06-liziba-rooftop.jpg", alt: "Rooftop terrace overlooking the Jialing River and Chongqing skyline", span: "wide" },
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/07-apartment-canyon.jpg", alt: "View between apartment buildings down to the river and bridge", span: "tall" },
]} />

And in the narrow gaps between apartment blocks, that same view compressed into vertical slices, framed by laundry and air conditioning units

Chongqing in a nutshell: density, verticality, and always - always - a river view if you know where to look

## After Dark

As the sun set, made my way to **黄桷古道 (Huángjué Gǔdào)** - the Huangjue Ancient Trail. stone steps dating back to the Tang Dynasty, winding up the hillside in Nan'an District. from up here, the view of **洪崖洞 (Hóngyádòng)** - Hongya Cave - is unreal. during the day it's just another hillside neighborhood. at night, it transforms into something out of a Miyazaki film

<BentoGrid images={[
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/09-hongyadong-night-view.jpg", alt: "Hongya Cave lit up at night - traditional buildings cascading down the hillside, golden lights against the dark sky", span: "wide" },
  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/10-skyline-night-rooftops.jpg", alt: "Chongqing skyline at night from the old town - traditional tile roofs in foreground, modern towers and red-lit bridge across the river" },
]} />

Eleven stories of traditional stilt architecture built into the cliff face, lit up in gold. the whole thing feels impossible - ancient wooden buildings clinging to rock while the modern skyline glitters across the river

That red bridge in the distance is **东水门大桥 (Dōngshuǐmén Dàqiáo)** - Dongshuimen Bridge. the contrast hits different at night: tile roofs and air conditioning units in the foreground, glass towers reflecting off the Yangtze behind

### Walking the Bridge

Couldn't resist walking across. the cable-stayed bridge stretches over the river, with the full Chongqing skyline glittering on both sides. red lanterns hanging from the cables, buildings lit up in gold and blue, the haze giving everything a dreamy quality

<BentoGrid images={[

  { src: "/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/18-bridge-walk-night.jpg", alt: "Looking down the bridge deck toward the illuminated skyline" },

Ended the night at a cozy bar tucked into the old town. wooden beams, red decorations left over from Chinese New Year, cocktails on a tiny round table

![Cocktails at a hidden bar in the old town](/assets/blog/chongqing-2026/11-bar-cocktails.jpg)

The kind of place you stumble into and don't want to leave
